Quote Generator:

<h3>https://shawshanck.github.io/quote-generator/</h3>

It is a template that uses basic HTML5, CSS and JavaSript to fetch an API in order to load data (Quotes) from a website.

* Fetch "Quotes" and " Author" text from API.
* Using twitter API for sharing and posting the quote.

Skills that I learned by doing this project:

* HTML: Creating loader, container, button, and importing fontawsome icons.
*
